# HuffleShuffle Scanner Device Access Rules
# This file grants the pi user access to HID scanner devices

# Generic HID device rule - grants rw access to pi group for all HID devices
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", GROUP="pi", MODE="0664"

# Alternative: If you need to target a specific scanner device by vendor/product ID
# Uncomment and modify the lines below with your scanner's USB IDs
# To find your scanner's IDs, run: lsusb
# SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1234", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5678", GROUP="pi", MODE="0664"

# Create a symlink for easier access (optional)
# This creates /dev/huffle-scanner pointing to the actual hidraw device
# SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", GROUP="pi", MODE="0664", SYMLINK+="huffle-scanner"
